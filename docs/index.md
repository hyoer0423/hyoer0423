### Project description
Code Coverage Inference Using a Neural Network Model 2021.06 - Present
• Test code generation: successfully generated the regression and error-revealing test code using Randoop.
• Do the preprocess to the input and use Abstract Syntax Tree to obtain code embeddings.
• Train an attention-based Neural Machine Translation model to predict the code coverage.
• Optimize the model to get the covered code text more efficiently and accurately.


Out of Distribution Detection in Machine Learning[https://github.com/zzb66666666x/LearnOOD] 2021.09 – Present
• Based on Out-of-Distribution detector for Neural networks to analyze and summarize different methods for detecting
out of distribution data in machine learning.
• Take Early-Layer Output of deep classifiers as input to the one-class support vector machine to detect the OOD. Optimization of Lattice's Thermal Conductivity 


Based on Genetic Algorithm 2020.05- 2021.05
• Used Lammps and GPUMD software to perform molecular dynamics simulations.
• Imported the data into OVITO to observe the results and compared them to judge the disorder.
• Implemented Machine Learning Genetic Algorithm to perform crossover and mutation to the disordered atomic
arrangements, and finally selected the optimum thermal conductivity through “natural selection”
